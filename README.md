# meteorological-stations-network
The present Diploma has the purpose of creating a network of meteorological 
stations, which will collect data recorded by the stations and send them to a suitable 
database at a central server. Based on science of IoT, we take advantage of the most 
evolved editions of microcontrollers, microcomputers, sensors and software with a 
goal to create an autonomous and separable network of distant placing and 
monitoring of the stations and the data they produce. The network we designed and 
constructed has its own graphic interface for user interaction, implemented as a 
webpage. Specifically, the webpage, gives the user the possibility to monitor in real 
time the sensors measurements of the stations connected to the network. Basic 
goals, was the capability of easy implementation of the network to any environment 
necessary for any user, the easy separation of the network in case a user doesnâ€™t 
want to use all the stations and the collection of reliable weather data at the area 
that the network is implemented. For the easy separation of the network we made 
every station autonomous, with a different communication protocol with the server,
In order each station to be capable to stand alone as the network.
